Episode 3: How Much Does an LLM Cost for My Company?

*Nowadays, every company is looking to include Generative AI in their daily operations, but it is often unclear how much it will cost them. In this episode, we will break down these costs for you. We will assume that a company wants to implement a chatbot with 2 users that answers questions based on specific company data.*

# Introduction

The CEO of Company XYZ is requesting a chatbot that uses sales documents to answer questions such as: "Where does the customer who bought items today live?" or "How many purchase orders were made today for each item?" It seems obvious that a dashboard would be a significantly better option, but the CEO envisions that customers will interact with this chatbot in the future to track their own orders without the need for the current call center department. The data involved includes purchase orders in the form of PDFs. What are we going to do? We are going to explain parts A, B, C, and D, resulting in the total cost of an LLM application.
